# Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection

Online payments have revolutionalized the modern economy but at the same time, the number of frauds have also increase. 
So, here is a fraud detection model created using Python and Machine Learning to identify fraudulent transactions.

The dataset is collected from Kaggle.
We will find out which transactions are marked fraud and study the correlations between the Fraud marking and other parameters.
Then, to create an ML model using sklearn, we will split the dataset into training and test sets. We will train the model using this data which will learn which transactions are fraudulent.
